## Login/logout

A login is required to create your own collection of playlists. 
DiskYT relies on social login functionality provided by Google and Facebook.
When you authenticate via social login certain information becomes available to DiskYT. 
In addition to some random token this information
includes your name, email, avatar, and probably some more stuff. DiskYT does store your name and avatar 
but not your email or anything else. The stored information remains private with DiskYT.
It's up to you to decide what name is publicly visible 
to visitors of your stations.

These settings are available on your **Profile** page: 
- go to **All Stations**
- hover over one of your Stations
- <img src="img/user-icon-s.png" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-bottom:10px"> - 
select **All User's Stations** icon 
- <img src="img/profile-icon.png" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-bottom:10px"> -
click **Profile** icon at the top of the page 
- toggle **Edit** mode to start profile editing

The **Profile** page is further discussed in the [Profile chapter](Profile.md).

If you use a public computer, always ensure that you not only log out from DiskYT, 
but also from your Google/Facebook page.

If you decide to completely remove your profile (including all your Stations and playlists), 
go to your **Profile** page, 
toggle **Edit** mode and follow the instructions on the page.
