We hope you will love DiskYT!

DiskYT allows you to enjoy your playlists on any mobile device (either via browser or using the DiskYT Android app).
However, the playlist creation and editing process is heavily based on laptop/desktop browsers, 
which support the drag and drop functionality across browser tabs. Editing your playlist on a mobile device,
while possible, is tedious and limited. 

In addition to the documentation, video tutorials are available on the 
[DiskYT YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOPsP033uljR72Isa4xvoqQ/videos). 
The visual layout in the videos slightly differs from the latest DiskYT version, 
but the main concepts are well explained.
