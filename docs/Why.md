## Why

YouTube is great, but playlist handling often feels limited. Many simple manipulations 
are not supported or are cumbersome. 
Some great features were available in the past, but were removed since. 

DiskYT is here to finally remedy this situation. What is even better, DiskYT is not an all or nothing proposition. 
You don't need
to subscribe to our playlist vision, but you can still use DiskYT as a super convenient 
friendly tool to move your YouTube playlists around and edit them as necessary. 
And you will be pleasantly surprised while
you discover more and more features that DiskYT provides, making it possible to do tasks that you never thought 
could be done at all.

In addition, the YouTube site often feels rather noisy with a lot of things going on. Sometimes it's fine, 
but other times you want something more serene and slow pace.
You may also want a bit more control of how your playlists are organized and presented. 

In the beginning, we envisioned mainly playlists of songs - as watching actual videos on the tiny 
embedded YouTube player is not very fun. 
But actually there is nothing limiting you to music, any type of video will work just fine, 
especially since a full screen mode is just a click away.

All in all, we feel there is some room to experiment with the playlists.

Please join us in our journey, let's have more fun with YouTube playlists.
