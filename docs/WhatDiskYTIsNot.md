## What DiskYT is not

DiskYT is not a tool to download YouTube videos or YouTube video sound tracks.

DiskYT also does not host any of the YouTube videos. 

As all the videos are hosted on YouTube, there is no support for the offline mode - connection to the YouTube
site is always required for the playback. 

Furthermore on mobile, due to embedded YouTube player restrictions, you cannot listen to your DiskYT playlists 
when you do not have the DiskYT app or DiskYT site open on your mobile device screen (in other words, DiskYT
does not function as a media player in the background - it needs to be open to be used).

DiskYT is a platform to better manage your YouTube playlists. You may slice and dice any playlists
available on YouTube, organize them in a folder structure that makes sense to you and either listen/watch
your playlists directly from DiskYT (via the embedded YouTube player) or copy these playlists back
to your YouTube channel.
